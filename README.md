# React Practice

## 題目一：產品清單 Product List
#### 題目參考：React 文件－[用 React 思考](https://zh-hant.reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
* 搜尋篩選產品
* 顯示庫存類型  
  
  
## 題目二：Tic-Tac-Toe Game
#### 題目參考：React 文件－[學習指南](https://zh-hant.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* 顯示遊戲狀態：下一位玩家、贏家、平手
* 儲存遊戲紀錄：玩家可回顧整個遊戲歷史階段，並可隨機復原到指定版本的九宮格局面
* 當前動作提示：在動作列表中，（重新被選取的）目前動作階段加以醒目樣式
* 改寫Board：使用兩個Loop建立九宮格，取代預設範本
* 若已出現贏家，則點擊九宮格中的任何空格皆無法再繼續畫記

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
